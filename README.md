A simple but powerful pomodoro-like application that blocks any distracting apps during focus sessions.

## Features
1. Customize a focus period anywhere from 5 minutes to 4 hours
2. Customize the fierceness of the focus session:
  - Allow pausing
  - Allow cancelling
  - Allow changing settings
  - (WIP) Allow the task manager
  - (WIP) Allow the terminal
3. Customize the apps you can use during a focus session
4. (WIP) Customize the websites you can access during a focus session
5. A clean, minimalist and elegant UI
6. No hacks around. I built the app and still don't know how to bypass it üòú
